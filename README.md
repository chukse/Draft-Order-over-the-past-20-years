# NFL Draft Success Analysis Over 20 Years

## Introduction
This project analyzes NFL draft picks from the last 20 years to determine draft success in terms of average draft order and total weighted Approximate Value (AV). This analysis helps in understanding which teams have made the most of their draft positions.

## Data Source
The dataset used is `draft_picks (3).csv`, which contains historical data on NFL drafts.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python along with several libraries including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script `draft_analysis.py` to generate the analysis. This script loads the data, processes it, and plots the results using team logos for visual reference.

## Output
The output is a plot titled "NFL Draft Success Over 20 Years", which visualizes each team's average draft order against their total weighted AV. It helps identify the teams that have efficiently utilized their draft picks.
